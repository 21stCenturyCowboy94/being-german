            <p>Guten Tag my friends. My name is N. Kenneth Ho, I am an American of Chinese, Irish, German, and Swedish
                descent. In this website, I will be exploring with you what life is like when you have ancestry from
                Germany,
                and the positives and negatives about it.</p></br>
            <p>In the United States, people of German ancestry make
                up the second largest in the entire population, second only to English-descendants. In the 1800s and
                1900s,
                more than seven-million Germans immigrated to the USA from Germany. The Germans immigrated to the USA
                for a number of
                reasons including war, poverty, religious persecution, political problems, economic insecurity, famine,
                crime, and other issues. Today the vast majority of German-Americans live in the Northern half of the
                United
                States, in a chunk of the country that goes from Pennsylvania to Oregon known as the "German Belt."</p>
            </br>
            <p>Today, not many Germans come to the USA, and Germany itself is now a country where many people
                immigrate to. Despite the fact a century has gone by since the waves of German immigrants came to the
                USA,
                the legacy of ther German immigration is still felt in many ways to this day.</p></br>
            <p>In my home state of Oregon, about one-fifth of the population has German ancestry, which makes sense
                considering Oregon is in the German belt and that my DNA test showed that I am part-German.</p></br>
            <p>Being German-American comes with a lot of things, includng positives like history, culture, food, and
                famous people, and negative things like bad history.</p></br>
            <p>To start, the history of Germany is really cool. Germany has been the home of many things including the
                development of technology, science, and music. Many famous things were invented in Germany. Things like
                the automobile, the printing press, the cable train car, and blimp were all invented in Germany.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Many famous scientists and inventors came from Germany, including Werner von Siemens, Max Planck,
                Johannes Gutenberg, and Albert Einstein.</p>
