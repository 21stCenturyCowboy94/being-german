        <p>Guten Tag my friends! My name is N. Kenneth Ho, I am an American of Chinese, Irish, German, and
            Swedish
            descent. In this website, I will be teliing you about the great country of Germany, things from and about
            Germany, and I will be exploring with you what life is like when you have ancestry from
            Germany,
            and the positives and negatives about it.</p></br>
        <p>Germany is a country in Western Europe. It is the most populated country in Europe, and has the largest
            economy on the continent. It has centuries of history and has made many contributiuons to the world in
            things like music, technology, science, and other achievements. Germany has seen times of prosperity, war,
            famine, and peace, and today it's one of the most powerful countries in the world.</p>
        </br>
        <p>In the United States, people of German ancestry make
            up the second largest in the entire population, second only to English-descendants. In the 1800s and
            1900s,
            more than seven-million Germans immigrated to the USA from Germany. The Germans immigrated to the USA
            for a number of
            reasons including war, poverty, religious persecution, political problems, economic insecurity, famine,
            crime, and other issues. Today the vast majority of German-Americans live in the Northern half of the
            United
            States, in a chunk of the country that goes from Pennsylvania to Oregon known as the "German Belt."</p>
        </br>
        <p>Today, not many Germans come to the USA, and Germany itself is now a country where many people
            immigrate to. Despite the fact a century has gone by since the waves of German immigrants came to the
            USA,
            the legacy of ther German immigration is still felt in many ways to this day.</p></br>
        <p>In my home state of Oregon, about one-fifth of the population has German ancestry, which makes sense
            considering Oregon is in the German belt and that my DNA test showed that I am part-German.</p></br>
        <p>Being German-American comes with a lot of things, includng positives like history, culture, food, and
            famous people, and negative things like bad history.</p></br>
        <p>To start, the history of Germany is really cool. Germany has been the home of many things including the
            development of technology, science, and music. Many famous things were invented in Germany. Things like
            the automobile, the printing press, the cable train car, and blimp were all invented in Germany.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Many famous scientists and inventors came from Germany, including Werner von Siemens, Max Planck,
            Johannes Gutenberg, and Albert Einstein.</p></br>
        <p>This website will explore the history and culture of Germany, and the realities and culture of
            German-Americans,
            including what its like, and the experiences we have.</p>
