        <p>Guten Tag my friends! Today I am going to tell you the story of German-America! As a German American, I am
            very proud of my heriatge and it is a great honor for me to share all of this with you. </p></br>
        <p> The history of Germans,
            German immigration, and German ancestry in the United States of
            America goes all the way back to the colonial times. In the original thirteen colonies of the United States,
            many immigrants from Europe came over, including Englishmen, Irish, Scottish, Dutch, Welsh, Swedish,
            Norwegian,
            Danish, and French just to name a few. However, there was one group that came over that became one of the
            most
            important groups in US History; Germans. Millions of Germans immigrated to the United States of America over
            the past three centuries, and they have had a very important impact on American Society.</p></br>
        <p>One of the earliest instances of German immigration to the United States was when William Penn invited
            Germans escaping religious persecution to settle in his colony of Pennsylvania. Many Germans immigrated to
            Pennsylvania over during the colonial times of the USA, and by 1790, when the US Constitution was being
            ratified, around one-quarter of Pennsylvania's population was German. German immigration to the USA would
            continue over the next century and a half, with more than seven million arriving.</p></br>
        <p>In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, millions of Europeans left Europe to escape poverty, war,
            religious persecution,
            and other reasons. People came to the USA from countries like Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Germany, Russia,
            Poland,
            Italy,
            Greece, Sweden, and Norway. However, off all of these groups who immigrated to the USA, there was not one
            that was as extensive and as plentiful as German immigrants.</p></br>
        <p>As the USA expanded westward, many immigrants started to immigrate to the regions of the country further
            west. German immigrants settled mainly in the northern-half of the mainland USA. That northern-half of the
            USA where many German immigrants settled is known as the "German Belt" and it extends from Pennsylvania to
            Oregon. States like California and Texas have a fair number of German descendants, but not as many per
            capita as the Northern-half of the USA. States in the Midwestern USA, including Wisconsin, Minnesota,
            Michigan, and Iowa all have huge amounts of German ancestry, even more than other states in the German
            Belt.</p></br>
        <p>The Germans who immigrated to the United States brought a lot of things, including culture, language,
            religion, and food. Many of the German immigrants who came to the USA were Protestant Christians, though
            some were also Catholics. The German language become very prominent in communites across the USA, and today
            more than a million people in the USA still speak German at home.</p>
