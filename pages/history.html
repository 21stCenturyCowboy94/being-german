        <p>Germany is a Western European country, it has a history that spans back about fifteen hundred years.</p>

        </br>
        <p>In its early days, the land of Germany expanded from the Oder River in the east, to the Netherlands in the
            west. It was bordered by the lands of France to the west, Poland to the east, Italy to the south, and
            Scandinavia to the North. In the eleventh century, the German states formed what would be known as the Holy
            Roman Empire.</p></br>
        <p> The Holy Roman Empire was centered in the land known as Austria, and was controlled by a royal family known
            as the Habsburgs. The Holy Roman Empire controlled all fo the German speaking areas of Europe, and also
            included some other states including Slavic states like Bohemia
            (modern day Czechia), and parts of Italy and France. In the middle of the second millienium, the Holy Roman
            Empire began to lose areas in is western areas as France expanded eastward. At the same time that France was
            expaning eastward, the Holy Roman Empire was expanding east also. Parts of the Holy Roman Empire, like
            Bohemia and Austria, began taking parts of nearby states like Poland. Polish territories like Silesia and
            Pomerania were annexed by the Holy Roman Empire over the centuries. As time went on, a new entity was
            created in the Holy Roman Empire, the entity was known as Prussia.</p></br>
        <p> Prussia was founded on an area on the
            Southeastern coast of the Baltic Sea. It eventually united with another state within the Holy Roman Empire,
            called Brandenburg, creating the state known as Brandenburg-Prussia.</p>

        <h3>Part Two: Dissolution of Holy Roman Empire, Mass Emigration, and German Unification</h3>
    </div>
    </br>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>By the nineteenth century, the Holy Roman Empire was the biggest entity in mainland Europe. However in 1806,
            Napoleon Bonaparte and his country of France invaded and dismantled the Holy Roman Empire, ending it
            forever, and giving each of its states a large degree of autonomy.</p></br>
        <p> Over the next seven decades, the areas of
            the German speaking peoples of Europe began to see rapid
            change. Events like war, famine, and religious persecution led to millions of Germans emigrating to other
            countries, mostly the United States. A violent revolution in 1848 was the most significant event that fueled
            mass emigration of people from the German States. However, despite all of these adveristies affecting the
            German states, a German Nationalist movement began to start in Prussia, and in the 1860s, Prussia decided
            that it wanted to
            unify a single
            German nation under its rule.</p></br>
        <p>In 1866, Prussia, under the leadership of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck (pictured below) went to war with
            Austria and several
            other German-speaking states that were once part of the Holy Roman Empire, including Wurttemberg,
            Baden, and Bavaria. Prussia was victorius and it secured alliances with the other German States that had
            allied with Austria. This war was known as the Austro-Prussian War.</p></br>
    </div>
    <div class="image-container-body">

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In order to secure the creation of a unified German nation, Prussia went to war again in 1870, this time
            against France. In 1870, Prussia, along with Wurttemberg, Baden, Bavaria, and other German-speaking states
            that were once part of the Holy Roman Empire, invaded France and captured Paris, and forcing France to
            surrender the next year.</p></br>
        <p>At the Palace of Versailles in Paris in 1871 (pictured below), Otto von Bismarck and the victorious Prussian
            authorities
            proclaimed the creation of the German Empire. The German Empire was to be composed of Prussia as the
            dominating power, with its capital in the Prussian capital of Berlin, along with other Kingdoms like Baden
            and Bavaria who were to be ruled under the thumb of
            the Prussian Monarch, but still maintain their own monarchies and semi-independant states. The head of the
            new German Empire was to be a monarch named Kaiser Wilhelm I.</p></br>

    <div class="image-container-body">

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Despite their victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War, and the succesful creation of the new German
            Empire, the balance of power in Europe was severly disrupted, and things were to become tense for the next
            few decades. France was very resentful of Germany because of the war the Germans waged against it, the
            humiliating defeat it suffered at the hands of the Germans, and the annexation of a French territory called
            Alsace-Lorraine. Austria, despite being a German-speaking state, didn't join Germany, and continued to be in
            its union with Hungary; the Austrians
            were also not happy with the creation of the German Empire becuase of the loss they had suffered at the
            hands of the Prussians five years earlier. Other countries such as Britain and the USA, reacted to German
            unification with negativity, whereas countires like Russia reacted positively.</p></br>
        <p>Germany also became a colonial power. In 1880, Germany hosted a bunch of countries in its capital of Berlin
            to discuss of the European countries would divide and colonize Africa. It was a very heinous time, because
            the European colonization of Africa was marked by genocide, repression, destruction of culture, and other
            atrocities across Africa.</p></br>
        <p>Despite the tension brewing in Europe because of German unification, the German Empire was to see a lot of
            success and advancemtn over the next few decades. Between 1875 and 1905, Germany saw massive
            industrialization, massive economic growth, wealth gains, advancements in innovation and technology, and
            many
            other triumphs. The first automobile was invented by Karl Benz in the city of Stuttgart, located in Baden.
            Many German companies began to make their marks on the world, including companies like Siemens,
            Mercedes-Benz, and Audi just to name a few.</p></br>
        <p>By 1900, Germany was the largest economy in Europe and the
            second largest economy in the world, bust behind the United States of America. Germany also had massive
            military power by the turn of the twentieth century, and had immense capabilities.</p></br>
        <p>However, despite all of
            the positives, Germany was an authoritarian country, and didn't have a democratic system it its
            government like Britain or France did. In 1888, after Kaiser Wilhelm I died, his grandson and new German
            Monarch,
            Kaiser Wilhelm II took over. In 1890, two years after Kaiser Wilhelm II became Emperor of Germany,
            Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, despite the fact that he had
            given Germany its existence eighteen years earlier, was ousted because Wilhelm II felt he was not good for
            Germany.</p></br>

        <h3>Part Three: World War I</h3>
    </div>
    </br>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Despite all of its successes, the German Empire, and peace in Europe, were not to last. In the early 1910s,
            Europe began to rumble; countries across the continent had formed alliances due to ideological differences,
            and the imbalance of power on the continent. A lot of this was due to German power on the European
            continent, and what Germany was doing at the time.</p></br>
        <p>In the 1890s, Kaiser Wilhelm II decided to make Germany adopt an aggressive foreign policy; aimed at
            expansion, economic dominance, and political control over as many places in the world as possible. By the
            1910s, Kaiser Wilhelm's aggresive foreign policy had become so powerful, it was too much for the balance of
            power in Europe to survice.</p></br>
        <p>By 1914, there were two alliance
            groups that had formed withing the European continent: The Entente (made up of UK, France, and Russia), and
            the Central Powers (made of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire). On June 28th, 1914,
            a Serbian citizen shot and killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Throne of Austria-Hungary. One month
            later, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and Germany joined the war shortly after, thus beginning the
            First World War.</p></br>
        <p>Germany and the other Central Powers went to war with the Entente. Germany invaded Belgium to invade France,
            and then proceeded to invade Russia. Despite Germany and its allies winning the war at first, the country
            made a series of mistakes that brought the United States into the conflict on the Entente's side; the
            sinking
            of the British ship the Lusitania, the Zimmerman Telegram to Mexico, and exerting unrestricted submarine
            warfare, all caused the USA to declare war on Germany in April of 1917. </p></br>
        <p>Germany was no match for the United States, and they suffered a huge defeat. On November 11th, 1918, Germany
            signed a ceasefire with the Entente, ending the First World War, and beginning a very tough period of time
            began. The second Kaiser of Germany, Wilhelm II fled to the Netherlands and a new republican government was
            created</p></br>

        <h3>Part Four: Weimar Germany, and Adolf Hitler's rise</h3>
    </div>
    </br>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The next year, in 1919, the
            Entente created a conference called the the Versailles Conference, a conference that Germany was not invited
            too and
            did not participate in. Under heavy pressure and demands from France and Belgium (because of the
            Franco-Prussian War and the destruction they faced during the First World War), the conference presented
            Germany
            with a peace treaty called the Treaty Of Versailles. The
            treaty was a peace
            treaty for
            Germany that included the following terms: Germany takes full blame for starting the war, Germany was to pay
            France and Belgium thirty-three billion dollars in war reparations for damage cause during war, Germany must
            not have a military larger than one-hundred thousand personnel, Germany loses thirteen percent of its
            European territory, Germany loses its colonial overseas colonies, France occupies Rhineland in Western
            Germany until 1934. Even Though the Germans had not participated and not even had been invited to the
            conference, the new German government, known as the Weimar Republic, accepted the treaty. </p></br>
        <p>The new Germany was not at all the same as the previous Germany. Things in the Treaty Of Versailles,
            including
            the war guilt clause, the loss of territory, and the French occupation ruined the spirits of many Germans,
            and created a ton of resentment in Germany against the victorious countries of the First World War. The
            reparations that France and Belgium demanded were way more than Germany could pay, and as a result, the
            country printed more money, but it caused hyperinflation and lead to an economic fallout in Germany marked
            my widespread poverty, loss of wealth, political instability, and civil unrest. Although countries like the
            USA attempted to ease the troubles in Germany by doing things like securing a reparations-reduction
            agreement with
            France and Belgium, and giving a series of loans to Germany to try to help them fix their economy, it was
            nowhere near enough to improve a whole ton of things, and it couldn't undo the damage done to Germans'
            spirit
            and morale.</p></br>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>However, at the time, there was a
            certain person in Germany who was starting to gain attention across the
            country. He was an Austrian man, who was a failed art student, and a veteran who had fought for the German
            Empire during the First World War. His name was Adolf Hitler (pictured below), he was a spokes person for a
            political party
            called the German Workers Party, based in the city of Munich, capital of Bavaria, Germany. In 1921, he was
            given leadership of the party and renamed it to The
            National Socialist German Workers Party, better known as the "Nazi" Party. Despite their small size, The
            Nazi Party began to gain momentum really fast, and Hitler made a lot of effort to make sure that the world
            could see them.</p></br>
    </div>
    <div class="image-container-body">
        <img src="/images/evil-person.jpeg">
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Despite not being born in Germany and not even a German citizen, Hitler, like
            most of the German population, was furious with Germany's defeat in the First World War, the Treaty of
            Versailles and the suffering it caused, and other things going wrong in Germany.</p></br>
        <p>Hitler became famous as he
            made fiery political speeches, and rallied thousands of people to his cause. His rhetoric was hate-filled,
            and he held grudges
            agaisnt a number of certain peoples. Peoples like Roma, Poles, Blacks, and Migrants were all groups of
            people that Hitler despised and blamed for the torubles Germany was dealing with. However, of all the
            groups of people that Hitler despised and blamed, there was no other group whom he disliked more than the
            Jewish people. Hitler despised Jewish people, and made countless anti-semitic claims in speech after speech.
        </p></br>
        <p>By 1923, Adolf Hitler had become one of the mosty prominent figures in Germany. He had gained a good number
            of
            followers, and many people had joined or contributed to his party and his platforms. Because he was so fed
            up with all the problems in Germany, he was so popular, and he had many people following him, Hitler decided
            that something had to be done about the Weimar Government. In 1923, Hitler and a group of his
            followers formed a militia at the Nazi headquarters in Munich. Their goal was to overthrow the government in
            an armed uprising and coup. Hitler and his militia went along with their plan, but they were unsuccessful
            and were defeated. Hitler was arrested and charged with treason. He was sentenced to just nine months
            in prison due to his convincing testimony and speech in court about rebuioding Germany, which made the
            judges sympathetic to his cause as they
            were very aware of the problems Germany was dealing with at the time.</p></br>
        <p>While Hitler was incarcerated, he wrote a book called "Mein Kampf" which bascially contained all the elements
            of his evil and hateful political views and platforms.</p></br>
        <p>After he was released from prison and the 1920s progressed on, Hitler and the Nazis began to take control of
            Germany. When the Great Depression began in 1929, Germany sunk even further into the ground. Hitler
            campaigen on a promise of economic recovery, restoration of national pride, and punishment for those
            responsible for Germany's troubles. By 1933, The Nazis has become the largest party in the German
            parliament, and Hitler won the position of Chancellor (leader) of Germany. The Nazis power gain was
            influenced by both democratic mean, and brute force.</p></br>
        <p>In 1933, a huge fire burned down the Reichstag, the German Capitol Building. While there has never been a
            definite answer of who burned the building, Hitler used it as justification to declare a state of emergency,
            and restrict freedom of speech, the press, expression, and other freedoms. After the death of German
            President Paul von Hindenburg in 1934, Adolf Hitler became the Führer, or dictator of Germany, and thus
            began his regime of evil and horror.</p></br>

        <h3>Part Five: Hitler, The Nazis, The Holocaust, and World War II</h3>
    </div>
    </br>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Adolf Hitler declared he had created the "Thousand Year Reich" (Reich means Empire in German). He immidiately
            started his campaign promises, including economic reforms to grow the economy, restore national pride
            through events and foreign policy, and punishing those deemed responsible for Germany's recent troubles.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Hitler's policies of punishing the enemies of Germany included segregation, taking away citizenship,
            encouraging citizens to commit crimes against those deemed enemies, and many other awful things. During the
            early years of
            Hitler's regime the Nazis opened a place known as a "concentration camp," near Munich. A concentration camp
            was a place to send people to work, starve, thirst, and suffer, and in this case Hitler and the Nazis opened
            concentration camps to extiminate Jews and other people deemed enemies of Germany. The first concentration
            camp was called "Dachau," and it was opened northwest of Munich. This was the beginning of a genocide known
            as the "Holocaust," and it was an evil time.</p></br>

    <div class="image-container-body">
        <img src="/images/speech.jpeg" alt="Hitler's speech">
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Over the course of the 1930s, Germany rebuilt its military, rebuilt its economy, and began to try to expand
            its territory. In 1938, Hitler and his Germany invaded and annexed Austria, and later that year, after
            talking with the Britain and France, Germany invaded and conquered park of Czechoslovakia. The reason
            Britain
            and France allowed Germany to take Austria and Czechoslovakia because they had suffered a lot from the
            First World War, and they really didn't want another war to happen. Hitler signed a pact with Italy, and
            also signed a seperate pact with Soviet Russia, and continued trying to expand.</p></br>
        <p>On September 1st, 1939, Germany crossed the line by invading Poland. Two days after German troops crossed
            into Poland, Britain and France (the Allied Powers) both declared war on Germany. Two weeks after German
            troops invaded the
            western half of Poland, Soviet Russia launched an invasion from the east and occupied the eastern half of
            Poland.</p></br>
        <p>In 1940, Germany began to conquer Europe, occupying most of the continent, and continuing its crimes
            including
            the Holocaust. Also in 1940, Germany and its ally Italy signed a pact with Japan, creating the Axis Powers.
            In June, 1941, Germany terminated its treaty with Soviet Russia, and invaded it, which secured
            Germany's defeat in the war as Soviet Russia joined the Allied Powers against Germany. Germany also secured
            its fate by declaring
            war on the USA later that same year after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.</p></br>
        <p>Germany and its Axis allies fought against the Allied Powers until 1945 when the USA, Britain, and Soviet
            Russia had liberated Europe, and forced Germany to surrender. Hitler commited suicide before Germany
            surrendered, and his evil regime came to an end. All in all, more than eight million Germans had died in the
            war, and more than six million Jews and five million others across Europe had been murdered in the
            Holocaust.</p></br>

        <h3>Part Six: Defeated, Destroyed, and Divided</h3>
    </div>
    </br>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>After Germany surrender in the Second World War, the country was in total ruins. Its cities were destroyed,
            its
            economy was in ruins, it had lost a large chunk of its land in the eastern regions of the country to Poland
            and the Soviet Union, and it
            had suffered millions of deaths. The allied nations decided to split Germnay's remaining territory into
            four occupation zones. The USA, UK, and France controlled the western two-thirds of Germany, and the Soviet
            Union controlled the eastern third of the country. The German capital city of Berlin was also divided, with
            the USA, UK, and France controlling the western half of the city, and the Soviet Union controlling the
            eastern hald of the city.</p></br>
        <p>The areas of Germany that were given to Poland after the war are known as the "Polish Recovered Territories."
            They are called that name because the areas of Germany that were given to
            Poland include
            regions like Silesia and Pomerania, which were originally Polish but were taken by the Holy Roman Empire and
            Germany over the centuries. The area in the far northeast was known as East Prussia, with the city
            Königsberg, which was given to the
            Soviet Union's Russia while the southern two-thirds of the province were given to Poland. Königesberg, East
            Prussia was the site where
            Prussia was founded and where the king of Prussia was crowned.
            Königsberg was largely torn town, its German heritage destroyed, rebuilt with Soviet and Russian style
            and infrustructure, and renamed as Kaliningrad (in honor of Soviet politician Mikhail Kalinin who died in
            1946). The ethnic German populations in the areas lost to Poland and
            the Soviet Union were expelled and resettled within the new borders of Germany, and the areas taken from
            Germany
            were populated by Poles and Russians.</p></br>

        <p>In 1947 The USA, Soviet Union, UK, and France held tribunals in the American-occupied area of Germany to try
            Nazi officials for their crimes in the Second World War, including the Holocaust and the concentration
            camps. Many Nazi officials were convicted of crimes and
            were sentenced to death or prison.</p></br>

        <h3>Part Seven: West and East Germany</h3>
        </br>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In 1949, As the western Allied Powers were rebuilding their areas of Germany, and the Soviet Union was
            managing its occupation zone, the Western Allies and the Soviets, because of their ideological differences,
            refused to give over their parts of Germany,
            which meant that Germany was to be split into two countries. The three western countries merged their
            occupation zones of Germany to create the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), and the Soviets turned
            their occuption zone of Germany into the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).</p></br>
        <p>New governments with new
            leaders were established in both Germanies, with West Germany becoming a
            capitalist-democratic country in an alliance with the Western democracies, while East Germany became a
            communist county under the control of the Communist
            regime in Soviet Russia. West Germany was granted sovereigenty and independence in May, 1955 as a member of
            the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (The Western Military Alliance formed after World War II), while East
            Germany became a puppet-state of the Soviet Union in the Soviet military alliance known as the Warsaw Pact
            (The Warsaw Pact also included Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary).</p></br>
        <p>East Berlin became the capital of East Germany, while the town of Bonn became the capital of West Germany.
            Starting in the 1950s, West Germany saw rapid economic growth and its currency was one of the strongest in
            the world. West Germany's economy and infrustructure were rebuilt, and West Germans enjoyed a high quality
            of life, good economic conditions, and political freedom.
            Meanwhile, in East
            Germany, the economy there did not have any real economic growth, its infrustructure wasnt rebuilt, and its
            citzens lived in poverty with no political freedom under the repressive East German government.</p></br>
        <p>The two
            Germanies began to look very different, and the possibility of reunification seemed impossible. Because of
            the high quality of life, strong economy, and political freedom in West Germany, many East
            Germans tried to move to or escape to the west, which the East German and Soviet governments did not want.
            To stop East Germans from moving to the west, the Soviet Union and East Germany built a wall in Berlin
            to stop people from escaping. This wall was known as the Berlin Wall, it was built in 1961 and blocked East
            Berliners from West Germany for nearly three decades.</p></br>

        <h3>Part Eight: Reunification and Reconciliation</h3>
    </div>
    </br>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Throughout the years until 1989, Germany remained divided between east and west. However, in the 1980s, the
            Soviet Union and its communist empire in Eastern Europe (including East Germany), began to fall apart. Many
            countries in Eastern Europe began to desire democratic governments and capitalist economies.</p></br>
        <p> In 1989, Poland held a referendum and an election, which led to the country becoming the first in the Warsaw
            Pact to establish a democracy, and abandon communism. This event marked the beginning the end of communism
            in
            Eastern Europe. Shortly after Poland rid itself of communism, East Germans heard the news from Poland and
            began
            protesting, which led to the East German government being so overwhelmed that they allowed the citizens to
            tear down the Berlin Wall and travel into West Germany and beyond. One by one, each and every country in the
            Soviet bloc, including East Germany, abandoned communism and broke ties with the Soviet Union.</p></br>

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>After the Berlin Wall fell, West German Chancellor Hemlut Kohl began to demand that Germany reunify. The
            four victorius powers of World War II, The USA, UK, USSR, and France, all began to talk with each other and
            the two Germanies about reunification. The USA supported German reunification, while USSR, France, and UK
            were reluctant. Helmut Kohl was able to convince USSR and France to allow German reunification, and the UK
            was forced to accept German reunification after the three other victorious powers agreed to it. Helmut Kohl
            wanted to regain some of the land Germany lost after World War II, but the victorious powers refused so Kohl
            decided to accept only East Germany. On October 3rd, 1990, the German Democratic Republic unified with and
            became
            part of The Federal Republic of Germany, thus creating a single German State under the government of the
            Federal Republic that was created in West Germany in 1949. The Federal Republic of Germany moved the capital
            to Berlin, and German reunification was complete.</p></br>
        <p>Only a year later, in 1991, the Soviet Union broke up into a bunch of different countries, thus ending the
            Cold War. With the division of Germany being over, and the threat of Soviet aggression in Europe no longer
            around, Germany had to make a lot of decisions in the 1990s. Some of the things Germany had to do were:
            reconcile with its tragic past of war and destruction, grasp with its dark past of the Nazis and the
            Holocaust, and it had to rebuild the economy and infrustructure in the former East Germany. Despite
            incredible efforts, and lots of hard work, Germany still has plenty of divisions and issues, even though
            more than three decades have passed since the country reunified.</p>
